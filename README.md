# Introduction to Solid State Physics
This is a compilation of all my lecture notes in 
introductory solid state physics. By the end of each chapter, there are plenty of self-paced exercises and solutions
that you can take at any time. Note that there are questions that you need to do and submit. 
All the best!!
